# Breast Cancer Classification with Logistic Regression
This project uses logistic regression to predict if a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer dataset.
# Project Description
This project applies logistic regression to classify tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset. 
The goal is to build a simple machine learning model that can help in early breast cancer detection by predicting the nature of the tumor based on several input features like mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.
